<b>Comics were started in the 1800s, a century which saw the development 
of modern colour printing and many other inventions. Wood engraving was a 
cheaper type of illustration which was widely used in the 19th century. 
These things are important because they created an understanding that illustrations 
are sometimes just as important as words.</b>

<b>The first comic strip appeared in France in 1889, and in 
the U.S.A. in 1897.[3]

Some later examples from the U.S.A. are Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and the X-Men. 
Some comic companies are DC Comics and Marvel Comics.

Since the middle 20th century many comic books are about superheroes, but many others 
are about other things. DC and Marvel comic books introduced Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Justice League, 
Teen Titans, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. 
Very often, characters in books, video games, movies and television appear in comics, and sometimes comic book characters are used 
in movies, TV shows or video games.</b>
